Create a convolutional neural network for the CIFAR10 data set 
Load the CIFAR data in Keras
Make sure that the data is divided into: training set, validation set, test set
Use the training set to train your neural networks
Evaluate their performance on the validation data set
After trying several different architectures, choose the one that performs best of the validation set
Train this final architecture on the data from the training set and validation set
Evaluate its performance on the test set
