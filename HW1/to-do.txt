Problem 3
Create network with an input layer consisting of 28 x 28 input neurons and an output layer consisting of 10 output neurons.
Use softmax and categorical cross entropy loss.
Implement mini-batch stochastic gradient descent using only numpy, that is, you are not allowed to use TensorFlow/Keras for SGD.
